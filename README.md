it will work like when use click on startgame it will genarate random numbers  and if the sum of the number less the 20 it will show the message "Do you want to draw a new card" and when sum is equal to 21  it will generate "wohoo! you've got Blackjack" and sum is greater than 21 then it will show the message "you are out of the game"
and if you want new card you can add useing newcard button
